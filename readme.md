What is Tree Notation?
----------------------

Tree Notation is a simpler kind of code. Tree Notation is an error-free base notation like binary. This is our current stack of computer languages:

1 Binary => 1,000+ Syntaxes => 10,000+ languages

In the future we think the stack may look like this:

1 Binary => 1 Tree Notation => 10,000+ Tree Languages

We all use software tools to build software. Tree Notation makes building these tools significantly easier, and as more people join the Tree Notation ecosystem there will be significant network effects.

What is special about Tree Notation?
------------------------------------

Tree Notation may seem similar to notations like JSON, XML, YAML or S-expressions. However, Tree Notation is the most minimal, is grounded in 3-dimensional geometry, and the concept of syntax errors does not exist. We think this makes Tree Notation substantially different and will cause a *major improvement* in computing. Read the [FAQ](https://treenotation.org/faq.html) to find out what major problems in computer science Tree Notation solves.

Advanced Examples
-----------------

Check out the [Ohayo](https://github.com/treenotation/ohayo) project or the [Tree Language Builder](https://treenotation.org/designer/) for advanced examples of Tree Notation in action.

Basic Examples
---------------

Below are some very simple examples to explain some of the very basics. The Tree Notation syntax is the same in both languages. The semantics are different. The semantics come from "Tree Language" implementations and libraries, which anyone can design and build.

#### For file formats:

Currently all Node.js npm projects contain a "package.json" file. While this is simple, it could be simpler using Tree Notation, and better. Let's take a look.

package.json:

    {
      "name": "mypackage"
      "version": "2.1.1"
      "description": "A package",
      "repository": {
        "type": "git",
        "url": "git://github.com/username/mypackage"
      }
    }

package.npm:

    name mypackage
    version 2.1.1
    description A package
    repository
     type git
     url git://github.com/username/mypackage

It may look like the only benefit is fewer syntax characters, but there's actually a lot more we can now do. Our "package.npm" grammar file gets typechecking, autocomplete, tailored syntax highlighting ([github highlighting coming soon](https://github.com/treenotation/jtree/issues/55)), can support multiline strings, strings without quotes that don't require escaping, comments, and more.

Note: the JSON example above works correctly, but JSON and Tree Notation are not equivalent by default, since JSON does not support certain structures and Tree Notation does not implement all JSON types by default. If you want JSON features such as keys with spaces, numbers, or arrays, you'll need to use a higher level Tree Language such as [Dug](https://treenotation.org/designer/#standard%20dug) that has a 1-to-1 relationship to JSON.

#### For programming languages:

In the example below, Tree Notation is used as a base for a math Tree Language where traditionally S-Expressions/Lisp might be used.

make8.math:

    multiply
     add 1 1
     add 2 2

make8.lisp:

    (* (+ 1 1) (+ 2 2))

The second example contains 13 parts, whereas the first only has 7. There are also infinite ways to represent the second example, since the compiler ignores insignificant whitespace, whereas in the first there is only 1 way to represent that particular structure.

Terminology
-----------

#### Tree Notation vs Tree Languages

There is a very important distinction between *Tree Notation* and *Tree Languages*. Tree Notation is a simple dumb format for encoding Tree Data structures. Tree Languages give you higher level semantics. There is not a single general purpose "Tree Language", like you might expect if you come from the Racket or Lisp worlds. Instead, there are many independent general purpose "Tree Languages" with any semantics desired by the language designer(s).

#### Data structures

The Tree is *the* data structure in Tree Notation. Types like booleans, ints and vectors only exist at the higher level Tree Language level. The theory behind Tree Notation is that concepts like booleans, ints and vectors are just kinds of Trees.

    interface TreeNode {
      parent: &TreeNode
      children: TreeNode[]
      line: string
    }

#### Basic terms

Example:

    if true
     print Hello world

In Tree Notation, the units of measure are **words** and **nodes**. Each line is equal to one node. The example program above has 5 words and 2 nodes. In this language the nodeType is termined by the first words (if and print). Notice how the second line in the program above is indented by one space, this makes the print node a **child node** of the line above it, the if node.

If you are familiar with Lisp terminology, you can think of words as atoms.

Grammar files add the additional concept of **cells**, which can be thought of as placeholders and type information for words. Grammar files define new languages with **nodeTypes** and **cellTypes**. In the example language above, the word "true" would be in a boolean cell type.

Here is a [longer spec](https://github.com/treenotation/jtree/blob/master/spec.txt).

Grammar Files
-------------

This library contains a Tree Language called "Grammar". You can write new Grammar files to define new languages. By creating a grammar file you get a parser, a type checker, syntax highlighting, autocomplete, a compiler, and virtual machine for executing your new language. This library also includes a simple web [Tree Language Builder](https://treenotation.org/designer/).

To make your language do really interesting things, you'll want to write some code to extend your language nodes in another language that you know. This jtree library lets you create new languages using just Tree Notation, Tree Notation + TypeScript, or Tree Notation + Javascript.

Tree Notation and Tree Languages can be built with any language, however, not just TypeScript and Javascript. Many more Tree Notation libraries are in the works for many different host languages.

Who this Library is For
-----------------------

This library is for people who want to design Tree Languages, make Tree editing tools, use TreeBase, or use the Tree Component Web Framework.

You can think of this library as similar to the Java Development Kit, except for Tree Notation instead of Java.

Using this Library
-----------------

This library currently includes about 7 compiled projects (aka "products") and more than a dozen Tree Languages.

### jtree base library for npm projects:

    const {jtree} = require("jtree")
    const tree = new jtree.TreeNode("hello world")
    console.log(tree.toString())

### jtree base library for the browser:

    <script src="node_modules/jtree/products/jtree.browser.js"

### jtree command line tool

    npm install -g jtree
    jtree help

### TreeBase

    npm install -g jtree
    jtree base

### jtree "sandbox" web app for exploring base Tree Notation

    npm install -g jtree
    jtree sandbox

### jtree "Designer" web app for building new Tree Languages

    npm install -g jtree
    jtree sandbox
    open http://localhost:3333/designer

### TreeComponentFramework for building web apps

(directions coming soon)

### More than 12 example Tree Languages for helping with various tasks

See the "langs/" folder.

### Build Tools

If you look at the source, you will also see a set of build tools (such as Builder and TypeScriptRewriter). These are currently undocumented and not recommended for external use.

Monorepo
--------

This library is a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo). With on average over 1 major version released each month for the past 2.5 years, it would take a lot of overhead to constantly be updating 10+ different repositories and modules every month. Once we're more confident in the theory and best practices, it might make sense to break this repo into independent modules.

That being said, we despise unnecessary dependencies as much as anyone. If anyone wants to create some automated submodules built from the projects in this monorepo, to allow for consuming of a smaller subset of the code and dependencies in this module, feel free to do so.

Who is working on Tree Notation?
--------------------------------

The Tree Notation Lab at the University of Hawaii Cancer Center is focused entirely on building and supporting the Tree Notation ecosystem, with a special focus on building data science applications that leverage Tree Notation to advance cancer research.

Development Status
------------------

All breaking changes are mentioned in releaseNotes.md. We follow semantic versioning, so breaking changes should not happen if you stay on the same major version.

Tree Notation Libraries in Other Languages
------------------------------------------

If you build a Tree Notation library in another language, let us know and we'll add a link.

If you are working on a Tree Notation library in a new host language, feel free to post an issue or ask for help in the [TreeNotation subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/treenotation/).

Research
--------

You can read the half-baked [papers about Tree Notation](https://github.com/treenotation/jtree/tree/master/papers).

The basic gist of the theory is that all structures are trees, Tree Notation is all you need to represent trees, and by building things up from Tree Notation we might be able to make things simpler *AND better*.
