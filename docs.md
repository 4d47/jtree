Highlight Scoping
=================

The @highlightScope property links keywords and wordTypes to scopes for coloring in Sublime and other editors.

You can also reference the file "scopes.list". These are taken from here: https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/scope_naming.html (parsed with: str = ""; for (el of document.getElementsByTagName("li")) {str += el.textContent.trim() + "\n"}; copy(str) )
